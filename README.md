## Key Features of the app
- Using their Github account, the user logs into the app. The Passport library willÂ manage the Github OAuth flow.
- Github returns an Access Token when the OAuth flow has been successfully completed, which the application can use to request that the user create a new repository in their Github account.
- Along with other user information like the username and profile URL, this token is kept in a SQLite database. Used DB sequelization as ORM
- It makes advantage of session-based authentication. Additionally, user sessions are kept in the backend SQLite database.
- After a successful login, the backend creates a cookie and sends it back to the user. On subsequent queries, this cookie may be used to recognise the user.
- Sessions are removed from the DB when they expire or the user logs out.
